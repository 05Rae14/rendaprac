 <p align=" center-left"style="padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px;" font="Roboto Condensed" >
 AI is being used in intelligent transportation systems, autonomous vehicles, and traffic management to assist in navigation, judgment, 
and adapting to changing traffic conditions.
<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/robot-car-intersections-are-terrifyingly-efficient"> (Ackerman, Robot Car Intersections Are Terrifyingly Efficient, 2012)</a>
 However there are concerns, such as job displacement, moral dilemmas, and safety concerns.
 AI-driven vehicles may face job displacement in sectors like transportation and taxi services, while autonomous vehicles may face moral dilemmas. 
 AI systems can adjust performance based on data and make complex decisions based on patterns and facts, unlike traditional linear programs.

<p align="center-left" style="padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px;">
transportation AI presents both opportunities and challenges. Safety concerns include potential accidents and dangerous situations,
 especially with driverless vehicles. Cybersecurity risks include hackers controlling autonomous vehicles and interfering with traffic management 
 systems. Data privacy concerns arise from unauthorized data collection and analysis
 <a href="https://medium.com/oxai/careers-in-ai-ai-in-transportation-d5b58e9b4873">
 (Cummings, 2023 )</a>. Opportunities include improved traffic management, 
 efficiency, and safety, as well as environmental benefits like reduced emissions and promotion of hybrid and electric vehicles.
 AI systems use hardware and software redundancy for backup and emergency override methods to reduce hazards. Overall,
 AI presents both opportunities and challenges in transportation.

 <h2 style="padding-left: 40px" >The future if AI transportation </h2></font>
 <p align="center-left" style="padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px;">
 AI is poised to revolutionize the transportation industry, enhancing safety, efficiency, and customer experience.
 It will be used in driverless vehicles, mass transit, and organization, and will improve traffic management technologies.
 AI will also enhance customer experience through predictive maintenance, better navigation, and ride-sharing services.
 In the long run, full autonomy may become common, potentially reducing accidents and traffic jams. The transportation system
 will become more connected, enabling real-time data sharing for traffic control and security.
 <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-to-make-autonomous-cars-trustworthy-and-free-from-cybersecurity-threats">
 (Conure, 2021)</a> AI will also be crucial in advancing environmentally
 friendly modes of transportation, such as ridesharing and autonomous vehicles. AI will create jobs in various roles, including engineers,
 technicians, safety oversight, data analysts, maintenance technicians, and public transit operations.
